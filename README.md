Slot Machine Game implemented in JavaScript Made by Robin Su! 

In this game, the user can: 
	- deposit money 
	- bet on lines
	- spin the machine 
	- win or lose money 

Overview of the process: 
The game runs in this loop:
1.Deposit some starting funds
2.Choose how many lines (1-3) to bet on
3.Place a bet per line (total bet = bet Ã— lines)
4.Spin the reels (3x3 grid of symbols)
5.Check each row for matching symbols
6.Payout winnings if matches occur
7.Repeat or exit the game
